```bash
python --version
```

3. **Install dependencies (if any)**

This project uses only standard Python libraries (`argparse`, `json`, `os`), so no additional dependencies are required.

## Usage

The CLI provides four main commands: `add`, `list`, `done`, and `delete`.

### Add a Task

* ‚úÖ Completed

### Complete a Task

```bash
python todo.py done 1
```

Marks the task with the given index as completed.

### Delete a Task

```bash
python todo.py delete 2
```

Removes the task with the given index from your list.

## Example

```bash
$ python todo.py add "Finish Python project"
‚úÖ Task added: Finish Python project
